# Programming Arcana

The Programming Arcana is an open source programming text book that focuses on teaching introductory programming concepts.

The guiding principles are:

- Transferable concepts are more important than language specifics
- Build concepts on top of known concepts as much as possible
- Focus on procedural programming initially, with a view to transitioning to objects
- Build programs that make it easy to see what is happening in the code
